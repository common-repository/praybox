PrayBox is being used to manage prayer requests on WordPress websites all over the world.

== Description ==

PrayBox is a prayer request application that allows users to submit requests, or pray for existing requests, as well as allowing site administrators to manage prayer requests.  All requests can be moderated from the admin section and can be flagged by members as inappropriate requests.  There is a IP ban system in place as well to discourage improper usage.

Every time a request is prayed for, and the user clicks the "I Prayed For You" button, the requester will receive a nightly email detailing how many prayers they received that day.
